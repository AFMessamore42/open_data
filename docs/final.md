CBDB is a relational database of 427,000 men and women, mainly from the 6th through 19th centuries. Participants will be given a copy of the complete database.

## Special Event 2 - Lunch Talk: Localist Turns -- A Recurring Pattern in Chinese History (Nov 20th)

Every Chinese dynasty has experienced a localist turn in which the centralizing power of the founding gives way to increasing localism, but all localist turns are not the same. This talk will note the general phenomena and explore a the specific case of the localist turn under the Mongols's Yuan dynasty, the consequences of which have continued into the present. Using the particular case of Wuzhou (Jinhua) a prefecture in Zhejiang province,  the talk will show how a data driven approach, spatial and social network analysis can reveal trends in local society that would not be otherwise apparent.

Presenter: Peter K. Bol, Charles H. Carswell Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University

The special events are **not required**, but students in the class are prioritized.
